## What is it

Protection standard "Fail2ban" effectively blocks brute-force attacks, but also creates huge jails of IPs for large botnets with different IPs, by reading and updating this database of banned addresses at every connection. Youshallnotpass takes a different approach by allowing **only your IP** to connect to your machine.

Static IP and dynamic DNS are the best solution for this, but they are not free (even Entrydns and Dnsexit services, which are free, allow only a limited number of requests per month), and *iptables* doesn't even supports Dynamic DNS addresses as firewall rule.

But even if you have a fixed IP at home, or already have a Dynamic DNS, **what if you are on the go with your mobile phone?**

With Youshallotpass you can quickly add yourself to a whitelist, similarly as port knocking does, but without needing any specific client or extra configuration.

## How it works

It is simple as just visiting a web page, either with any **browser**, or with a **curl** script; you could even set up the web page address on your **modem** in the "custom dynamic DNS" page (i.e.: Fritz!Box supports that). Then Youshallnotpass will replace your previous IP address in the whitelist, with the your new one.

You can add as many as many address as you want!

All is done with a couple of simple and small BASH scripts using only POSIX commands (awk) without any additional third part software, and best of all: it's completely free and open-source with a **fuckmicrosoftandapple** license, so you are free to customize the script to fit your needs.

## Installation

No installation is required, just download the scripts on any location and you're ready to go.

## Components

- **PHP script:** *index.php*

  (upload it to any web hosting: when visited it will create a plain-text file containing the IP of the device visiting the page)

  

- **Main script:** *youshallnotpass.sh*

  (simply calls the firewall update sub-scripts, you can configure this file with your web hosting address, and this to cron to poll for any changes to your IP)

  

- **Firewall update script:** *youshallnotpass-firewall-update.sh*

  (automatically replaces your previous IP in the firewall whitelist, if it has changed)

**Logs are saved here:** */var/log/youshallnotpass.log*

**Previous IP address are saved here:** */etc/youshallnotpass/**.txt*

## Configuration

### On your web server / web hosting with PHP:

1. Upload *index.php* script on any free or paid web hosting of your choosing, in a subdirectory. MySQL database is **not** required.
2. **Add one of the following protections:**
    1. To avoid other people finding this subdirectory, make sure the file *.htaccess* on the webserver home, includes the following line: `Options -Indexes`
    2. Protect the your newly created subdirectory with a .htpasswd file
    3. Modify the PHP script to ask for a password

### On the linux server you want to protect:

1. Edit *youshallnotpass.sh* to add the URL address where you uploaded the PHP script. Example of configuration:

   ```bash
   youshallnotpass-firewall-update.sh http://yourwebsite.altervista.org/myip/ip.txt
   ```

2. Add the script to *cron*, **for user root** like this:

   `export VISUAL=nano; crontab -e`

   And add the following line:

   ```
   */10    *   *       *       *       /root/youshallnotpass.sh >> /var/log/youshallnotpass.log 2>&1
   ```

   **Note**: `*/10` to update the IP in the whitelist every 10 minutes, it should be often enough, but change it according to your preferences. As opposed to the Dynamic DNS, there is no limit to the number of requests.*

3. There is no need to modify the file *youshallnotpass-firewall-update.sh*, unless you want to change the default ports to open. Default ports: 21, 22 (FTP, SSH)

### Verify the rules and connections

1. Check the current firewall rules anytime with: `iptables -n -v -L`
2. Connect using another IP to verify if the protection is working

------

## Usage example

1. Once you ploaded the PHP script on your web hosting, simply **visit the page** from your device, with any browser.

   (You can also automate this process with a script that uses curl to get the page, or also by putting the web address into your modem at the section *"Dynamic DNS"*, if supported)

   **Note:** if you used .htpasswd protection you have to paste the URL like this:

   [http://username:password@yourwebaddress.com/subfolder/ip.txt](http://username:password@yourwebaddress.com/subfolder/ip.txt)

2. Wait for **cron** to execute the script **youshallnotpass.sh** you previously edited/customized with the URL where you uploaded the PHP script.

   (Suggested curl execution time for polling the new IP: 5-15min)

3. *youshallnotpass-firewall-update.sh* subscript will be called and replace (or add, if not present), a rule on iptables to let you in from the ports you selected. Everyone else will see the ports closed. Default ports: 21,22 (FTP, SSH), customize the script with the port you need if necessary.

4. Enjoy the view of botnets trying to enter, by monitoring the failed attempts with the command: `tcptrack -i eth0` üòÉ
